While the containment phase involves catching cases early and tracing all close contacts to halt the spread of the disease for as long as possible, the delay phase could mean the introduction of "social distancing" measures, such as urging people to work from home - if possible - and cutting back on socialising.

Closing schools and banning big events is less likely to happen.

However, if the virus becomes widespread, the government may decide to enter the mitigation phase, when health services are asked to focus on critical care and retired NHS staff could be asked to return to work.

Since then, cases have been reported across the UK, with the highest number so far seen in London.

But numbers are much lower than other European countries, such as Italy, for example, where there have been more than 7,000 cases and 360 deaths.

The number of cases in Germany and France is also rising.

While there were a number of people testing positive throughout February, figures in the UK began to increase significantly at the beginning of March.
